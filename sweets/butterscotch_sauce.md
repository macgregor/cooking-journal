## Notes

### Trial 1
Yielded about 1/2 cup of butterscotch sauce in the end, think I cooked off a little too much water. Was hoping for a little closer to a cup, but it turned out very delicious. Super sweet, understandably. Thickened up in the fridge but loosened up after sitting on the counter a few minutes. Microwave a few seconds if you are impatient.
