## Cauliflower Fire Sale
So they keep putting cauliflower on sale so I'm going to keep making cauliflower wings. This time BBQ. The BBQ sauce recipe was way better than the buffalo sauce I made last week. Also added a little corn meal to the wing batter but I cant tell if it has any effect on the final product. I'm experimenting with freezing them precooked and cooked to see how they will do in the freezer.
