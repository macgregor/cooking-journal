## Recipe Log
* [Pecan pie](../../../1-recipes/sweets/pecan_pie.md)

## Pie Quest 2017
I made 3 different pie crusts over the weekend. one turned out completely over cooked, one might even say burnt, the other was way over cooked to be made into a pie but not burnt (it because snack crackers) and the third turned out pretty good and became my first ever [pecan pie](../../../1-recipes/sweets/pecan_pie.md). Actually, now that I think about it I don't think I've ever had pecan pie before. I didn't like pecans as a kid and would just eat pumpkin instead. So I have no reference point for what it should taste like. It's mostly sugar and butter though, so I have a pretty good idea.

I reserved a few slices to test how the baked pie lasts on the counter vs in the fridge vs in the freezer.

## The Luna is Dead, Long Live The Luna
My first starter was a bit of a disaster. Saturday morning I pronounced her dead. The starter was soupy like I expected, but the hooch remained on top, it never grew and it was smelling worse and worse. I wrote up a post mortem in the [project journal](../../../3-projects/sourdough_starter_experiments.md). I also made two new starters, both identical except that one uses pineapple juice to lower the acidity from the outset of the fermentation process that will prevent the smelly bacteria from activating and pave the way for the yeast to activate more quickly. Hopefully I will have at least 1 active starter to make bread with this weekend. Will have to lookup some bread recipes.
