## Diet
I've gained about 10 pounds in the past 6 months or so, approaching 190 pounds form my low of about 180. I've gotten a little slack with snacking and eating sugary things. I am going to start counting my calories again to drop back to my goal weight of 175. Should take about two months. So I'll be eating more salads and vegetables. This will be a good chance to document some of the mason jar salads I used to eat a lot of. I will probably still stick with Indian for dessert as a lot of it is pretty healthy anyway.
