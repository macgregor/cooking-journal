# A Cooking Journal for a Cooking Journey
While trying to improve my cooking skills I find myself experimenting with different techniques or forming my own recipes from a half dozen different variations on the same recipe online or researching the science behind a process. I need a place to take notes and record my recipes and findings. So thats what this is.

 ## Recipes
 Here I record recipes that I use often or particularly like. Often I start with a recipe or group of recipes I've found and fill in holes I find or modify with extra ingredients. I'll link to recipes or give credit where appropriate, I am not trying to take credit for someone else's hard work. I just want the recipe in a place I know will always exist and can modify as I find the need.

 ## Cookbooks
 Reviews of cookbooks I own and worked through. This is a work in progress, I want to work most of the way through a cookbook before commenting on it. Ill also call out recipes that I loved from the books and ones that I hated (as long as I am sure it is the recipe at fault and not taste or lack of skill).

 ## Projects
 This is for in depth notes on research I am doing and experiments I conduct trying out different techniques. If I am really trying to perfect a recipe I don't want to make the recipe super long with notes, but I also don't want to lose those notes.

 ## Techniques
 Notes on specific techniques that need more explanation or nuance than can be put into a recipe directly.

 ## Journal
 Sort of like a blog for myself to keep track of what I did in a given week. I talk about what recipes I cooked, how I liked them, what I'm researching or experimenting with (the bulk of this will be recorded in Projects, but it will probably come up here too) and just generally thinking about.
