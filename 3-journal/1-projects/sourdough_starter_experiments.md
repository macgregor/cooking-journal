# Creating a Sourdough Starter Recipe


## Trial 1 - "Luna"
My first attempt. I learned alot. I started out by following a recipe I put together based mostly on [How to make a sourdough starter by Jacob Burton](https://stellaculinary.com/cooking-videos/stella-bread/sb-003-how-make-sourdough-starter) with some techniques thrown in from a few other sources. The amounts originally were enormous and I scaled them up or down a few times. It also got fairly cold around day 4. I think these variations played a part in the slow start.


**Date**: 11/05/2017, 6 pm.
* **Starter**: 250 g (unfiltered, mistake) water, 125 g King Arthur whole wheat, 125 g Pillsbury AP Flour.
* **Feed**: 250 g water, 125 g King Arthur whole wheat, 125 g Pillsbury AP Flour.

**Date**: 11/07/2017, scaled down to fit in smaller container
* **Starter**: 200 g
* **Feed**: 100 g water, 50 g King Arthur whole wheat flour, 50 g Pillsbury AP Flour

**Date**: 11/08/2017, scaled up to match new target recipe above
* **Starter**: 250 g
* **Feed**: 125 g water, 62 g King Arthur whole wheat flour, 62 g Pillsbury AP Flour

### Day 1
Had to go buy a larger glass container because my 1 quart mason jars weren't big enough. Got what I think is a half gallon mason jar, it wasn't labeled properly in the store. Still cautiously cut the recipe in half: 250 g water, 125 g AP flour, 125 g whole wheat flour. There is still plenty of room after mixing, think for first feeding I will not discard half to bring recipe up to full strength then discard half as normal maintaining a total weight of 1000 g. Also forgot to use filtered water, simply adding warm tap water. Whoops. Hopefully this wont impact taste or anything.


### Day 2
**Morning**: Mixture very thick, seems thicker than most I see online but that is probably due to water to flour ratios or maybe it will get soupier farther in the process. Some bubbles but still pretty inactive. Mostly just smells like wet whole wheat flower, but there is a little yeasty smell.

**Night**: Feed at 6 pm. 250 g (filtered!) water, 125 g AP flour, 125 g whole wheat flour. No discard, total weight after feeding should be 1000 g give or take. Now taking up around half my container. By the time I went to bed it had already grown noticeably by maybe a third. I wonder if it would have grown more noticeably initially if I had used filtered water instead of tap.


### Day 3
**Morning**: Woke up and whoa, its grown alot (note: in retrospect this is almost certainly a "false raise" from Leuconostoc bacteria that is a precursor to the yeast we want). I hope it doesn't outgrow my container. Stronger sour smell. Not overwhelming or bad, but noticeable. Undertones of yeast but faint. I don't think I need this much starter on hand, I will look up some recipes and probably scale it back.

**Night**: Feed at 6 pm. The starter shrunk back down to normal size, about half the size of the container. Interesting band of liquid in the middle of the liquid, assume this is alcohol. Mixed back together before feeding. Very strong sour smell. Not sure what is normal here, it isn't exactly sickening not rotten but it is strong. The starter is now the more soupy consistency I see online. I am scaling back the amounts significantly and moving to a new, smaller container (a 1 quart wide mouth mason jar). Total weight now is about 400 g. I added 200 g of the growing starter to a clean jar and then fed with 100 g water, 50 g whole wheat flour and 50 g of AP flour. Going to update recipe to target a 500 g starter. After scaling back and feeding the sour smell is much more reasonable. Need to look in to what is normal.


### Day 4
**Morning**: Looking good. Didn't bloom up like it did after the first feeding. I'm assuming that was due to some giant burst of activity producing lots of gas and its not something that happens every time you feed. There is a pronounced sour smell but it isn't as powerful as yesterday evening before I fed and scaled it back. This could be from simply having less volume of starter now. Film of liquid on top, this is called hooch in sourdough circles. Hooch is common and fine when activating a starter but you shouldn't have any if you properly maintain your starter after activating. I've been mixing it back in before feeding, which is normal. If there is alot I may discard it.

**Night**: Feed at 6 pm. Not much change since morning, a little more hooch and a slightly stronger sour smell. It got a little cold while I was at work. About 62 degrees when I got home, probably colder, that might have impeded growth. Scaling up slightly to hit my new recipe target weight of 500 g total starter, currently it is at approximately 400 g. Remove 150 g starter (250 g starter remaining), add 125 g filtered water, 62 g whole wheat flour, 62 g AP flour.


### Day 5
**Morning**: I'm starting to worry Luna is dead, or at least not very active for some reason. Looking the same as yesterday morning, not very bubbly, hooch on top, same size. I've been doing some research and it may not be hooch (alcohol) on top. It could just be water separating from the flour. It seems like this happens more commonly when you add too much water. Since I am weighing my ingredients and not using volume cups, this shouldn't really be the case. Need to taste it when I get home. As for whether or not it is dead, reading [this](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/10359/discouraged-southeast#comment-54426) makes me think it is simply developing slowly due to the temperature of my kitchen:
> When using just flour and water, many will grow a gas-producing bacterium that slows down the process. It can raise the starter to three and a half times its volume in a relatively short period -- something to behold. But not to worry; it is harmless. In fact, this bacterium is used in other food fermentation like cheeses and vegetables, and it is all around us in the environment, including wheat fields and flour. It does not grow at a pH less than 4.8, and the specified fruit juices serve to keep the pH low enough to by-pass it. Things will still progress, but this is the point at which people get frustrated and quit, because when the pH drops below 4.8, and it will, the gassy bacteria stop growing. It will appear that the "yeast" died on you, when in fact, you haven't begun to grow yeast yet. But they will come -- really, they're already there. When the pH drops below 3.5 - 4 or so, the yeast will activate, begin to grow, and the starter will expand again. You just need to keep it fed and cared for until then.

Will continue to feed as normal until the weekend before giving up and starting over.

**Night**: Feed at 6 pm. Remove 250 g starter, feed with 125 g filtered water, 62 g whole wheat flour, 62 g AP flour. Still seems inavtive. Same hooch, same smell. After reading some blogs and forums I am going to keep feeding this one a little longer while also starting my second trial.

### Day 6
No change. Smells bad. No bubbles as far as I can tell. Im calling it, Luna is officially dead.

### Postmortem
Im not entirely sure why Luna didnt make it. My best guess is poor planning and too many changing variables. I scaled the volume of starter up and down 3 times to adjust to different container sizes. My original recipe created far too much starter. While I think I kept all the ratios the same and it should have been fine, the stress might have caused problems. There was also a temperature drop on day 4 that wouldnt have helped. I believe the rise I saw on day 3 was a false rise caused by some bacteria that activate before the yeast can. This is pretty common and normally the yeast will active a few days later with regular feeding. Something happened after day 3 that prevented yeast from activating. I also didnt do a good job keeping the sides of the container clean after feeding. Not from lack of trying, my containers didnt lend themselves well to the job.

Lessons learned:
* be prepared and be consistent - I suffered from not fully planning what I was doing. Scaling the recipe up and down, changing containers, forgetting about filtered water...I think Luna suffered for it.
* keep some room temperature filtered water on hand - filtered water was always an afterthought right before feeding. Id put warm tap water into my water filter and use what I need. I've heard of people suggesting leaving your water on the counter for a day before feeding. I'm now leaving a 1 quart mason jar full of filtered water on my counter to use with starters.
* control as many variables as possible - keep temperature conditions stable, keep containers clean, use the same water, feed at the same time each day, use the same flour.


## Trial 2 - "Fred" and "George"
Inspired by [Debra Wink](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/10901/pineapple-juice-solution-part-2), I want to try a new experiment with a little more planning and control. Two starters, 1 that uses nothing but filtered water and 1 that uses unsweetened pineapple juice for the initial mix and first 2 feedings before switching the water. The acidity in the pineapple juice should prevent the initial "false rise" and smelly bacteria and make room for the yeast we want easier/faster.

Pineapple juice aside, here are some other general changes I am making based on research and my experience with Luna
Changes:
* Smaller batches - should fit in a 1 pint mason jar. Should end up maintaining about 90g of starter in the end.
* smaller ramp ups before discard + feed rather than discard + feed from the outset - the first 3 days, we will be simply adding small amount of flour + liquid, no discarding, no changing containers. After this, you can begin discarding before feeding and putting in clean containers if you want.
* 100% whole wheat starter before discard + feed stage - whole wheat seems to have more stuff yeast needs to get going so I am going to start with 100% whole wheat for the first 3 days. When we get to discard + feed I will switch to a 50/50 mix of whole wheat and AP flour.
* do a better job at keeping the container clean - I struggled to scrape down the sides of the larger containers when making Luna. With the smaller containers I should be able to keep the sides clean easier which will help prevent mold forming.
* room temperature filtered water - I am keeping a jar full of filtered water at room temperature to use for feeding. Before I was adding warm water to my Britta pitcher and using what I needed. Beside being a pain in the ass, it also meant the temperature was uncontrollable.
* same brand flour - coincidentally I am nearly our of the Pillsbury flour and picked up a bag of King Arthur Bread Flour. So now I'm all King Arthur. I've only briefly read about how flour affects the bread you make, need to do more research, but King Arthur seems widely well regarded.

**Date**: 11/10/2017, 6 pm
* Fred - water
  * Initial Starter: 15 g filtered water, 15 g King Arthur whole wheat flour
  * Feed (for 2 days): 15 g filtered water, 15 g King Arthur whole wheat flour
  * Discard + Feed (until active):  maintain a [2:1:1] ratio of starter to water to flour. 45 g starter, 22 g filtered water, 11 g King Arthur whole wheat flour + 11 g King Arthur bread flour
* George - pineapple juice
  * Initial Starter: 15 g unsweetened pineapple juice, 15 g King Arthur whole wheat flour
  * Feed (for 2 days): 15 g unsweetened pineapple juice, 15 g King Arthur whole wheat flour
  * Switch to water, Discard + Feed (until active):  maintain a [2:1:1] ratio of starter to water to flour. 45 g starter, 22 g filtered water, 11 g King Arthur whole wheat flour + 11 g King Arthur bread flour

### Day 1
**Night**: While still mourning Luna, I made Fred and George. These two are designed to be smaller batch, fitting in 1 pint wide mouth mason jars. Ill try not to mess with the amounts as much as I did with Luna. The two are identical, except that George is made with pineapple juice instead of water during the first few feedings. The idea is that the acid in the pineapple juice will prevent some of the smellier, gassier bacteria from being able to grow in the first couple days. The recipe also starts with small amounts of flour and liquid, forming a sort of paste. We add to this for a couple days then switch to the normal discard and feed method.

True to form, both Fred and George look very pasty. They seem identical except that George has a slightly pineapple aroma.

### Day 2
**Morning**: No change. Pasty, smell like pineapple or wet flour respectively. To be expected. Hoping to see a little activity after tonights feeding.
