Made full recipe for 2 crusts. My "food processor" (a ninja blender with a food processor bowl/blade) was a little small so I had to add butter and flour in pieces. I might have over processed the dough a little bit, it looked smoother and less clumpy than most pictures or videos I see. I ended up letting the dough rest for a couple hours after mixing in the butter but before adding water. I was cooking lunch and dinner at the same time and overwhelmed myself a bit. It should be fine though. Added about 4 tbsp of cold water, shaped it into discs and let rest in fridge for 3 to 4 hours. The dough weren't quite even and neither was enough to fill my pie pans. Need to add more flour next time. Also when rolling, the edges cracked quite a bit and fell apart easily when moving to pie pan. I'm looking up reasons why and it seems that it can be almost anything, no enough mixing, too much mixing, too little water, not letting it come up in temperature before rolling. Too many things to narrow it down without more tests. I'm docking the nicer looking crust and not docking the other to experiment with what happens if you don't dock.

Whoops. Baked them for way too long. Should have paid more attention but the aluminum foil and sugar made it difficult to see how well the crust was baking. Flavor and texture wise, its not bad even half burnt. I'm snacking on the least burnt bits of the bad pie. However, The crust doesn't hold up that well and crumbles easily. I might try to salvage the other pie crust, but more than likely make another batch tomorrow.


**Problems**:
* not enough dough to fill pie pan - scale up ingredients.
* edges cracking when rolling - many possible root causes. I am going to look be a little more diligent about how much water I add next time and letting the dough rest at room temperature for longer before rolling.
* baked crust for way too long. Also discovered hot spots in my oven. The left side got burned while the one on the right got dark golden, close to burning, but didn't get ruined. Cut bake time in half from 60 minutes to 30 minutes.

**Lessons Learned**:
* There doesn't seem to be a need to dock the crust before blind baking. Both the docked and undocked crust behaved the same way.
* Keep your ingredients cool, but you don't want the dough too cold when you are trying to shape it.
* Don't be overly paranoid about adding water to the dough, under watering can lead to fragile dough
