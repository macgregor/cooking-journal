# Sourdough Starter


## Equipment
* large glass container (half gallon)


## Ingredients
### Initial Starter
* 500g warm, filtered tap water
* 250g bread flour
* 250g whole wheat flour

### Feeding
* 250g water
* 125g bread flour
* 125g whole wheat flour

## Instructions
1. measure out 500g water, 250g bread flour and 250g whole wheat flour into a relatively large container. mix well by hand (using your hand adds some of the initial yeast to the starter)
2. cover container loosely or with a piece of porous cloth (e.g. cheese cloth), you want some air to get in while keeping dust and bugs out. Leave in warm place (65 - 68 degrees F is optimal) for about 24 to 48 hours. Bubbles should appear on the top of the batter indicating that the yeast is active and producing carbon dioxide. Any liquid on top is alcohol and can be mixed back in to your starter or discarded.
3. Feed and strengthen your starter. remove half of batter and discard (see notes below for ideas on what to do with the discarded starter other than throwing it away). add back water and flour equal to how much you removed: 250g water, 125g bread flour and 125g whole wheat flour. Mix well, no need to use your hand at this point.
4. Cover container loosely or with a piece of porous cloth and place in warm spot in kitchen just like before.
5. Check starter every 24 hours or so and repeat the feeding and strengthening process for 3 to 5 days. Try to feed the same time each day.
6. Use the float test to determine when your starter is ready to use: drop a spoonful of the batter into a bowl of water, if it floats your starter is ready to use, if it sinks, repeat the feeding/strengthening process. Use immediately to bake bread or see storage instructions below.


## Storage
Can be kept alive indefinitely if fed regularly.

### Short Term - feed daily
Leave on counter, feeding once every 12 to 24 hours following steps 3 and 4 above.

### Long Term - refrigerate, feed weekly
Store in covered container in refrigerator, feed once a week following steps 3 and 4 above. Seal container, dont use cloth or cover loosely like the initial feeding phase. Allow starter to rest on counter for about 2 hours after feeding before putting back into refrigerator. Before using to bake, feed for a couple days at room temperature following steps 3 and 4 above. Use float test (step 6) to determine when your starter is ready to use.


### Really Long term - months to a year

## Notes
* this recipe uses a 1:1 ratio of water to flour. You can use any combination of flours you want to achieve different flavor profiles, just make sure they add up to the weight of water you add, e.g. 500g water and 250g bread flour + 250g whole wheat flour. Ratio applies to both initial starter and any feedings.
* the yeast in this recipe comes from the air, the container, water, and especially your hands. This is why the initial starter is mixed by hand

### Trial 1 - 11/05/2017, "Luna"

#### Day 0
Had to go buy a larger glass container because my 1 pint mason jars werent big enough. Got what I think is a half gallon mason jar, it wasnt labeled properly in the store. Still cautiously cut the recipe in half: 250g water, 125g AP flour, 125g whole wheat flour. There is still plenty of room after mixing, think for first feeding I will not discard half to bring recipe up to full strength then discard half as normal maintaining a total weight of 1000g. Also forgot to use filtered water, simply adding warm tap water. Whoops. Hopefully this wont impact taste or anything.


#### Day 1
Feed: 250g (filtered!) water, 125g AP flour, 125g whole wheat flour. No discard, total weight after feeding should be 1000g give or take.
