# Sourdough Starter


## Ingredients
### Starter
* 500g warm, filtered tap water
* 250g bread flour
* 250g whole wheat flour

### Feeding
* 250g water
* 125g bread flour
* 125g whole wheat flour

## Instructions
1. measure out 500g water, 250g bread flour and 250g whole wheat flour into a relatively large container. mix well by hand
2. cover container and leave in warm place (65 - 68 degrees F is optimal) for about 24 to 48 hours. Bubbles should appear on the top of the batter indicating that the yeast is active and producing carbon dioxide.
3. feed and strengthen your starter. remove half of batter and discard. add back water and flour equal to how much you removed: 250g water, 125g bread flour and 125g whole wheat flour. mix well.
4. cover container and place in warm spot in kitchen just like before.
5. check starter every 24 hours or so and repeat the feeding and strengthening process for 3 to 5 days. try to feed the same time each day
6. Use the float test to determine when your starter is ready to use: drop a spoonful of the batter into a bowl of water, if it floats your starter is ready to use, if it sinks, repeat the feeding/strengthening process. Use immediately to bake bread or see storage instructions below.


## Storage
Can be kept alive indefinitely if fed regularly.

1. Once starter passes float test (step 6 above), allow starter to sit at room temperature for an hour after feeding then place into refrigerator.
2. Feed your starter following instructions above (steps 3 and 4 above).
  * If baking bread regularly (once a day): feed every 12 to 24 hours.
  * If baking less often (a few times a week or month):
    1. feed every 3 to 5 days, removing most of the starter. add water and flour equal to how much you remove
    2. before use, refresh your starter at room temperature with 1-3 feedings, using the float test to ensure starter is ready.
