# Buffalo Sauce

## Ingredients
* 1/2 c vinegar based hot sauce (e.g. Frank's Red Hot, Texas Pete)
* 1 tbsp butter
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 2-3 tbsp maple syrup

## Instructions
1. In a small pot over high heat, mix all the sauce ingredients.
2. Bring to a boil and boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.
3. Taste a little bit to decide if you need more sweetener to balance out the heat; if so, add a tablespoon at a time until your desired heat.

## Notes
* buffalo sauce was ok, but I think I need to research different wing sauces
