# Instant Pot Black Beans

## Ingredients
* 1/2 lb (about 1 cup) dried black beans
* 2 cups water
* 1/2 yellow onion, sliced in rounds (or 1 tbsp onion powder)
* 2 garlic cloves, sliced in half  (or 1/4 tsp garlic powder)
* 1/2 teaspoon cumin
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 bay leaves
* 2 teaspoon soy sauce

## Instructions
1. Place all ingredients in your Instant Pot.
2. Turn the steam release valve to sealing. Set your Instant Pot to cook on manual for 25 minutes (will take about 10 minutes to come up to pressure).
3. Allow to natural release for 10 minutes. Carefully use steam valve to release pressure.

## Notes
* Other spices I like to add sometimes if I want a more Indian take on things (not necessarily all at once): 1/4 tsp paprika, 1/4 tsp red pepper powder, 1/8 tsp asafoetida (hing) powder, 1/2 tsp chaat masala, 1/2 tsp garam masala.
* This recipe scales well, double or triple up if you need to make larger batches.
