## Notes
* guessing on amount of water and pressure cook time. May need to adjust both depending on how it comes out.
* Powder substitutes:
  * 3 garlic cloves = 1/2 tsp garlic powder
  * 1 onion = 1 tsp onion powder
  * 2 tsp ginger = 2 tsp ginger powder
* Indian food uses a lot of spices, if you don't have all of these that is ok, the important ones are: onion, garlic, ginger, cumin seed, salt, black pepper, paprika, cayenne, turmeric, and garam masala. Which is still a lot, but these are pretty easy to find in a regular store or a well stocked pantry.
