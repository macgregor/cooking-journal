# Chickpea and Farro Greek Salad

## Ingredients
* 1/2 c [chickpea and celery salad](../chickpea_and_celery_salad.md)
* 1-2 tbsp [Greek dressing](../dressing/greek_dressing.md)
* 1/2 c cooked farro (or other grain)
* 2 cup mixed greens
* 1 tbsp pumpkin or sunflower seeds
* 2 tbsp dried cherries or cranberries
* Kalamata olives pitted and thinly sliced (optional)


## Instructions
1. Layer the chickpea salad at the bottom along with an additional tablespoon or two of dressing, enough to lightly coat the salad when you turn the jar upside down.
2. Top with cooled farro, then greens (leave about an inch of room at the top).
3. Finish with sprinkle of pumpkin/sunflower seeds, dried cherries/cranberries and Kalamata olives.

## Notes
* You can toast the pumpkin or sunflower seeds over medium-low heat until they smell fragrant and brown slightly, a couple minutes. This will give them a more pronounced flavor.
