# Cauliflower Wings

## Ingredients

### Wings
* 1 medium head cauliflower, chopped into bite sized pieces (you don't want stems)
* 1/2 c AP flour
* 1/2 c almond or soy milk
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1 c bread crumbs

### Sauce
* 1/2 c vinegar based hot sauce (e.g. Frank's Red Hot, Texas Pete)
* 1 tbsp butter
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 2-3 tbsp maple syrup

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Line a baking sheet with silicone baking sheet or greased foil.
2. In a small bowl, whisk the 1/2 c AP flour, 1/2 c almond/soy milk, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper and 1/2 tsp garlic powder in a bowl to make the batter.
3. In a separate bowl, place the bread crumbs. Line it up beside the batter bowl.
4. Toss the cauliflower in the batter mixture one at a time, shaking off excess batter. Do not soak. Then, dip the cauliflower into the breadcrumbs to coat completely, then place onto the baking sheet. Repeat until all of the wings are coated.
5. Bake for 22 minutes.
6. While the wings are baking, in a small pot over high heat, mix all the sauce ingredients. Bring to a boil and boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Taste a little bit to decide if you need more sweetener to balance out the heat; if so, add a tablespoon at a time until your desired heat.
7. Remove from oven. Toss the wings in the sauce then using tongs, remove and place back on the baking sheet. Bake for another 5 minutes for the sauce to soak into the wings.

## Notes
* The batter will only adhere to the cauliflower wings dry. So, if for any reason you wet your cauliflower, it has to be 100% dry for the batter to stick.
* if the batter seems too thick, thin out with a few tablespoons of extra milk

## Storage

### Refrigerator - About 4 days
Store in air tight container, reheat in oven until warm.
