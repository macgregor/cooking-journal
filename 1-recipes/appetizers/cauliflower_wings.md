# Cauliflower Wings

## Ingredients

### Wings
* 1 medium head cauliflower, chopped into bite sized pieces (you don't want stems)
* 1/2 c AP flour
* 1/4 c corn meal
* 3/4 c almond or soy milk
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 1/2 tsp garlic powder
* 1 c bread crumbs

### Sauce
Use a store bought sauce if you want or make your own. Suggestions:
* [buffalo sauce](../sauces_and_dressing/buffalo_sauce.md)
* [brown sugar BBQ sauce](../sauces_and_dressing/brown_sugar_bbq_sauce.md)

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Line a baking sheet with silicone baking sheet or greased foil.
2. In a small bowl, whisk the 1/2 c AP flour, 1/2 c almond/soy milk, 1/4 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper and 1/2 tsp garlic powder in a bowl to make the batter.
3. In a separate bowl, place the bread crumbs. Line it up beside the batter bowl.
4. Toss the cauliflower in the batter mixture one at a time, shaking off excess batter. Do not soak. Then, dip the cauliflower into the breadcrumbs to coat completely, then place onto the baking sheet. Repeat until all of the wings are coated.
5. Bake for 22 minutes.
6. While the wings are baking, prepare wing sauce if not using store bought.
7. Remove from oven. Toss the wings in the sauce then using tongs, remove and place back on the baking sheet. Bake for another 5 minutes for the sauce to soak into the wings.

## Notes
* The batter will only adhere to the cauliflower wings dry. So, if for any reason you wet your cauliflower, it has to be 100% dry for the batter to stick.
* If the batter seems too thick, thin out with a few tablespoons of extra milk.
* You may need to double your sauce recipe depending on the size of your cauliflower, I did about a half a large head and didn't have as much sauce as I'd like.
* If you don't have corn meal just replace with extra flour.

## Storage

### Refrigerator - About 4 days
Store in air tight container, reheat in oven until warm.

### Freezer
You can freeze the wings after step 4. Place the lined baking sheet with battered cauliflower in the freezer for 20 - 30 minutes until the wings are partially frozen, then move them to a plastic bag. Bake as normal starting at step 5.
