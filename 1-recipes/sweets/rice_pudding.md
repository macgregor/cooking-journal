# Rice Pudding (Kheer)

## Ingredients
* 1 c cooked basmati rice
* 2 c soy milk
* 1/4 c sugar
* 1/4 tsp ground cardamom
* 1/4 tsp tapioca flour
* 1/4 c shredded coconut
* 1/3 c golden raisins or dried cranberries
* 1/3 c unsalted pistachios or almonds

## Instructions
1. In a large nonstick saut√© pan over medium heat, combine the 1 c cooked rice and 2 c soy milk. 
2. Heat until the mixture begins to boil. Decrease the heat to low and cook at a simmer until the mixture begins to thicken, stirring frequently, approximately 5 minutes.
3. Increase the heat to medium, add 1/4 c sugar, 1/4 tsp ground cardamom, 1/4 tsp tapioca flour and 1/4 c shredded coconut and continue to cook until the mixture just begins to thicken again, approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Use a whisk to help prevent the cardamom from clumping.
4. Once the mixture just begins to thicken, remove from the heat and stir in the raisins and pistachios. Transfer the mixture to individual serving dishes or a glass bowl and place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the pudding. Serve chilled or at room temperature.

## Notes
* this recipe is a work in progress, I had left over rice and wanted something sweet. Most recipes call for coconut milk for thickness which I didn't have so I substituted tapioca flour and dried coconut. It was tasty but much thicker than rice pudding should be.
