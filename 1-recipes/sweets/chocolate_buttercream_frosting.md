# Chocolate Buttercream Frosting


## Equipment
* Mixer


## Ingredients
* 85 g cocoa powder, unsweetened (sifted)
* 140 g vegan butter (softened)
* 1/2 cup non-dairy milk (room temperature)
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* pinch of salt
* 400 g powdered sugar (sifted)


## Mise en place
1. 85 g cocoa powder, unsweetened (sifted), 140 g vegan butter (softened), 1/2 cup non-dairy milk (room temperature), 1 tsp vanilla extract, salt
2. 400 g powdered sugar (sifted)


## Instructions
1. Add 85 g cocoa powder, 140 g vegan butter, 1/2 cup non-dairy milk, 1 tsp vanilla extract, salt to a large mixing bowl and using a spoon or your beaters, start mashing them together until the liquids thicken with the fluffy cocoa. Beat until smooth, use low setting if using a mixer.
2. Add in the powdered sugar one cup at a time and beat until fluffy. Do not over beat the frosting to avoid melting the vegan butter too much.


## Notes
* having a mixer is highly encouraged, it was very hard to get the right consistency mixing by hand. It was still good but not as fluffy as buttercream should be.
