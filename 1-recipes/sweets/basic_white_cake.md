## Notes
* Because this vegan white cake has very little fat, you might also want to line the pan with parchment paper to prevent it from sticking. My first attempt stuck very badly, I forgot to use flour which might be enough to prevent sticking but I think using wax or parchment paper is probably for the best.

* [sifting flour in baked goods](https://www.thekitchn.com/is-sifting-flour-for-baked-goods-really-necessary-213894) - usually not necessary, but some recipes do really need it:
> There are times, however, when certain recipes actually benefit from sifted flour. The flour in cakes with a very light, delicate texture like genoise, angel food, or sponge should be sifted to eliminate and prevent lumps that would weigh down the batter.
* [vinegar in baked goods](http://bakingbites.com/2008/08/using-vinegar-in-baking/) - used to to react with baking soda and start the chemical reaction needed to produce carbon dioxide and give those batters a lift as they bake.
