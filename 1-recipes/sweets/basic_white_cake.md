## Notes
* Because this vegan white cake has very little fat, you might also want to line the pan with parchment paper to prevent it from sticking.
* [sifting flour in baked goods](https://www.thekitchn.com/is-sifting-flour-for-baked-goods-really-necessary-213894) - usually not necessary, but some recipes do really need it:
> There are times, however, when certain recipes actually benefit from sifted flour. The flour in cakes with a very light, delicate texture like genoise, angel food, or sponge should be sifted to eliminate and prevent lumps that would weigh down the batter.
* [vinegar in baked goods](http://bakingbites.com/2008/08/using-vinegar-in-baking/) - used to to react with baking soda and start the chemical reaction needed to produce carbon dioxide and give those batters a lift as they bake.
