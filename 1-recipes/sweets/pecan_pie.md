# Pecan Pie


## Ingredients
* 1 [prepared pie crust](./pie_crust.md)
* 5 tbsp vegan butter
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 3/4 cup corn syrup
* 4 tbsp cornstarch
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 2 tsp vanilla
* 1 cup extra firm silken tofu
* 2 cups whole pecans


## Mise en place
1. 5 tbsp vegan butter, 1 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup corn syrup, 4 tbsp cornstarch
2. 1/2 teaspoon salt, 2 tsp vanilla
3. 1 cup extra firm silken tofu
4. 2 cups whole pecans


## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees
2. Pre-bake pie crust until golden brown according to instructions in the recipe.
3. Toast pecans in the oven at 350 degrees for 5 - 8 minutes, be careful not to burn them.
4. In a saucepan combine the 5 tbsp vegan butter, 1 cup brown sugar, 3/4 cup corn syrup, and 4 tbsp corn starch. Stir and cook over medium heat until it comes to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook for another minute. Add the 1/2 tsp salt, and 2 tsp vanilla and stir to combine.
5. In a food processor, add 1 cup silken tofu and pulse until smooth. Add the corn syrup mixture and pulse again until everything is combined. Add the pecans (reserving about 20 - 50 for the top) and use a spatula to stir them into the filling. Arrange the reserved pecans on top of the pie.
6. Place a cookie sheet on the bottom rack of your oven and place your pie on the cookie sheet. Bake for about one hour, until the edges of the pie are set. The center might still be a little jiggly. That's alright. Remove from the oven and allow to cool before serving.


## Storage

### Room temperature
Cover with aluminum foil or plastic wrap. Eat within 4 days.

### Refrigerator
Will lose some integrity in texture — the filling may separate a bit and the crust will get soggy. Eat within a week.

Wrap tightly in plastic wrap or foil.

### Freezer
Will lose some integrity in texture — the filling may separate a bit and the crust will get soggy.

Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and foil or place in a freezer bag. These pies can be frozen for up to two months. Thaw in the refrigerator.


## Notes
* I've never seen extra firm silken tofu. Ive only ever seen one kind of silken tofu that comes vacuum sealed and has a picture of a smoothie on it. Has a nearly yogurt consistency to it.
* It is hard to find information about storing vegan pies. Most pies need to be refrigerated because they contain milk and eggs. Not vegan pies though. In theory they should last pretty well on the counter for several days. Ill reserve a few pieces or testing fridge, freezer and counter:
  * counter -
  * fridge -
  * freezer -

### Trial 1
Optional
Notes on a specific trial of a recipe. Pontification and things to try differently next time
