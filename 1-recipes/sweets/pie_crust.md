# Basic Pie Crust


## Equipment
* food processor (optional, can use pastry blender or 2 knives and mix by hand)
* rolling pin


## Ingredients
* 300 g (2 1/2 cup) chilled all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 2 tbsp sugar
* 226 g (1 cup, 2 sticks) vegan butter, well-chilled and cut into cubes
* About 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons ice water


## Instructions
1. Pour two thirds (200 g, 1 1/2 cup) flour, 1 tsp salt, and 2 tbsp sugar into a food processor and pulse until combined, about 2 seconds.
2. Add 226 g (1 cup) vegan butter and pulse until dough collects in clumps, about 15 seconds.
3. Add remaining 100 g (1 cup) of flour and pulse until mixture is evenly distributed (4 to 6 quick pulses). Empty mixture into a medium bowl. If dough has warmed up too much, refrigerate for 10-15 minutes before continuing.
4. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time and fold into dough with a spatula until dough is slightly tacky and sticks together. Don't over hydrate or mix.
5. Divide dough into two even balls and flatten each into 4-inch disk. Wrap each in plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 30 minutes. At this point you can store dough for later use (see below) or continue.
6. Remove the dough from the fridge. If the dough has been refrigerated longer than 30 minutes, let it rest at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes before rolling, to allow the butter to soften up a bit.
7. Roll the dough to the size needed (about 12" for a 9" pie, use your pie pan as a reference). Place it in a pie pan. Trim crust to fit pie or optionally make a [decorative edge](http://www.recipetips.com/kitchen-tips/t--813/decorative-pie-crust-edges.asp)
8. (Optional) Prebake pie crust - if your recipe calls for prebaked (blind baked crust). Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Dock the crust: prick the bottom of pastry all over with a fork. Line the pastry with parchment paper; fill with pie weights or dried beans. Bake until pastry begins to color around the edges, about 30 minutes. Remove the parchment paper and weights and continue to bake just until the pastry dries out and turns a light golden color for a partially baked shell, and a deeper amber for a fully baked shell, 10 to 20 minutes more. Cool completely on a wire rack before filling.



## Storage

### Refrigerator - About 3 days
After forming dough ball (step 5 above), wrap in plastic wrap and place in refrigerator.


### Freezer - "a long time"
After forming dough ball (step 5 above), wrap in plastic wrap and place in refrigerator to firm up (30-60 minutes). Once dough is chilled and firm, place in plastic bag and put in freezer. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before rolling into crust.


## Notes
* this recipe makes enough dough for 2 single crust (e.g. pumpkin or pecan pie) or 1 double crust (e.g. classic apple pie)
* keeping your ingredients cold is important when making pie crust. chill your butter and flour. If your kitchen is warm you way need to pause the process to refrigerate/freeze the dough for a few minutes before continuing to the next step. Its especially important to keep the butter from melting. Your body temperature is high enough to melt butter, the more you handle the dough, the more it melts which will mess up the final product. Chilling the butter/dough as you work with it will help prevent this.
* poking the bottom of the crust with a fork after putting it in the dish is known as a [dock](https://www.thespruce.com/definition-of-dock-a-baking-term-480616). It allows steam to escape while baking so the crust doesn't puff up.
* [blind baking the crust](https://blog.kingarthurflour.com/2015/11/23/blind-bake-pie-crust/) may not be desired depending on what kind of pie you are making. Check your recipe to be sure so you don't undercook or overcook your pie crust.

### Trial 1
Made full recipe for 2 crusts. My "food processor" (a ninja blender with a food processor bowl/blade) was a little small so I had to add butter and flour in pieces. I might have overprocessed the dough a little bit, it looked smoother and less clumpy than most pictures or videos I see. I ended up letting the dough rest for a couple hours after mixing in the butter but before adding water. I was cooking lunch and dinner at the same time and overwhelmed myself a bit. It should be fine though.
