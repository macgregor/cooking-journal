# Graham Cracker Pie Crust

## Ingredients
* 1 1/2 cup graham crackers, about 10 crackers
* 1/4 cup sugar
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 4 tbsp butter, melted


## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Spray your pie pan with vegetable spray.
2. Process 1 1/2 cup graham crackers in food processor or blender until crumbly. Add 1/4 cup sugar, 4 tbsp melted butter. Pulse a few times until combined. The dough should be loose but form together into a ball when pressed.

## Notes
* If the crust isn't holding together well, add extra melted butter or use fewer graham crackers next time.
