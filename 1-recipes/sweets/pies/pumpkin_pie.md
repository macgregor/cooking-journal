## Ingredients
* 1 [prepared pie crust](./pie_crust.md)

* 3/4 cup full-fat coconut milk (the kind in a can, shaken well before measuring)
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 1/4 cup cornstarch
* 1/4 cup maple syrup
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 1/2 tsp salt
* 1 tsp ground ginger
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* 1/2 tsp nutmeg

## Mise en place
1. 1 3/4 cups (1, 14 oz can) pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling)
2. 3/4 cup full-fat coconut milk (the kind in a can, shaken well before measuring)
3. 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup cornstarch, 1/4 cup maple syrup, 1 tsp vanilla extract
4. 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp ground cloves


## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees
2. [Blind bake](https://blog.kingarthurflour.com/2015/11/23/blind-bake-pie-crust/) your pie crust - Line the pastry with parchment paper or aluminum foil; fill with pie weights, dried beans or sugar. Bake until pastry begins to color around the edges, about 10 minutes. Set the crust aside to cool while you prepare the filling. **reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees**
2. Make filling by mixing 1 3/4 cups (1, 14 oz can) pumpkin, 3/4 cup full-fat coconut milk, 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup cornstarch, 1/4 cup maple syrup, 1 tsp vanilla extract, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 tsp ground ginger, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1/2 tsp nutmeg, 1/8 tsp ground cloves in a large bowl or blender until smooth.
3. Pour into prepared crust and smooth top. Cover and refrigerate until ready to bake.
4. Bake at 350 degrees until filling is set, about 45 to 60 minutes.
5. Let cool, and then chill in the fridge for a minimum of 4 hours or (for best results) overnight until set.


## Storage

### Refrigerator
Might lose some integrity in texture — the filling can separate a bit and the crust may get soggy. Eat within a week.

Wrap tightly in plastic wrap or foil.

### Freezer
Might lose some integrity in texture — the filling can separate a bit and the crust may get soggy.

Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and foil or place in a freezer bag. These pies can be frozen for up to two months. Thaw in the refrigerator.


## Notes
* When you remove it from the oven, the edges might be slightly cracked and the middle will still look wobbly. This is ok, it will firm up in the fridge.
