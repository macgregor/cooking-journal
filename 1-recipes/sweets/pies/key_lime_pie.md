# Key Lime Pie

## Ingredients

### Filling
* 1 prepared [graham cracker crust](./graham_cracker_pie_crust.md)
* 1 14.5 oz can of full fat coconut milk
* 1 tbsp lime zest
* 1/2 to 3/4 cup lime juice (from 1 pound key limes)
* 1 1/4 cup soy milk
* 5 heaped tbs corn starch
* 5 tbsp powdered sugar
* 1/2 tsp Matcha, optional for color


## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.
2. Combine 1 14.5 oz can coconut milk, 1 tbsp lime zest and lime juice in sauce pan over medium-low heat.
3. Meanwhile, combine 1 1/4 cup soy milk, 5 tbsp corn starch, 5 tbsp powdered sugar and 1/2 tsp matcha powder in a mixing bowl and whisk until combined. Add extra matcha powder if it isn't green enough for you.
4. Add soy milk mixture to the sauce pan with coconut milk and lime. Reduce heat to low and stir constantly until it thickens. Once thickened, pour into prepared graham cracker crust.
5. Let cool slightly then gently cover with piece of plastic wrap, ensuring no air remains. Plastic wrap should lightly touch the filling, this prevents a film from forming on top of the pie. Refrigerate until set, at least 1 to 4 hours.


## Notes
* you can substitute Persian (regular ol') limes for the key limes but apparently key limes have a more more bitterness and a higher acidity. The site below suggests mixing 1:1 Persian lime to lemon juice as a substitute.
