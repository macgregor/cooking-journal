* 1/2 c cooked rice
* 1/2 avocado (diced)
* 2 c romaine lettuce (chopped)
* cilantro (optional)
* lime juice (optional)

1. Cook rice according to package.
2. Dice avocado, toss with a little lime juice to help with browning.
3. Assemble salad in mason jar in the order ingredients are listed.

## Storage
Will last in the fridge for 5 days. Lettuce will begin to get soggy and go bad first.

* Wide mouth mason jars can be used to eat directly from the jar, just make sure you leave enough room to mix it.
