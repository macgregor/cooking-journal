# Roasted Potatoes


## Ingredients
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 tbsp salt
* 4 pounds russet or Yukon Gold potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
* 5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
* 4 cloves garlic, minced
* 2 tbsp freshly chopped rosemary
* black pepper to taste


## Mise en place
1. 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 2 tbsp salt
2. 4 pounds russet or Yukon Gold potatoes
3. 5 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil, 4 cloves garlic, minced, 2 tbsp freshly chopped rosemary, black pepper


## Instructions
1. Adjust oven rack to center position and preheat oven to 450 degrees (or 400 degrees if using convection)
2. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. Add 2 tbsp salt, 1/2 tsp baking soda, and 4 pounds potatoes and stir. Return to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until a knife meets little resistance when inserted into a potato chunk, about 10 minutes after returning to a boil.
3. Meanwhile, combine 5 tbsp olive oil with 2 tbsp rosemary, 4 cloves of garlic, and a few grinds of black pepper in a small saucepan and heat over medium heat. Cook, stirring and shaking pan constantly, until garlic just begins to turn golden, about 3 minutes. Immediately strain oil through a fine-mesh strainer set in a large bowl. Set garlic/rosemary mixture aside and reserve separately for later use.
4. When potatoes are cooked, drain carefully and let them rest in the pot for about 30 seconds to allow excess moisture to evaporate. Transfer to bowl with infused oil, season to taste with a little more salt and pepper, and toss to coat, shaking bowl roughly, until a thick layer of mashed potatoâ€“like paste has built up on the potato chunks.
5. Transfer potatoes to a large rimmed baking sheet and separate them, spreading them out evenly. Transfer to oven and roast, without moving, for 20 minutes. Using a thin, flexible metal spatula to release any stuck potatoes, shake pan and turn potatoes. Continue roasting until potatoes are deep brown and crisp all over, turning and shaking them a few times during cooking, 30 to 40 minutes longer.
6. Transfer potatoes to a large bowl and add garlic/rosemary mixture and minced parsley. Toss to coat and season with more salt and pepper to taste. Serve immediately.


## Notes
* Large chunks of potato maximize the contrast between exterior and interior.
* Parboiling the potatoes in alkaline water (the baking soda makes is alkaline) breaks down their surfaces, creating tons of starchy slurry for added surface area and crunch.
* Infusing the oil with garlic and herbs gives the potato crust extra flavor.
