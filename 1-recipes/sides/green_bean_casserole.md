# Green Bean Casserole


## Ingredients
* 1 pound green beans, rinsed, trimmed and cut in half
* salt and black pepper
* 2 tbsp vegan butter or olive oil
* 1 shallot, minced
* 2 cloves garlic, minced
* 1 cup finely chopped mushrooms (button, baby bella, or cremini)
* 2 tbsp all-purpose flour
* 3/4 cup vegetable broth or water
* 1 cup unsweetened plain almond or soy milk
* 1 1/2 cups crispy fried onions


## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. Blanch the green beans. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt well - it will help season the green beans. Add green beans and cook for 5 minutes, then drain and place in an ice water bath to stop cooking. Drain and set aside.
3. In the meantime, start preparing sauce. In a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat, add 2 tbsp vegan butter or olive oil, shallots and 2 cloves garlic. Season with salt and pepper and stir. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then add mushrooms and season with a bit more salt and pepper. Cook for 3-4 minutes more or until lightly browned.
4. Sprinkle in 2 tbsp flour and whisk to stir and coat the veggies. Cook for 1 minute, then slowly add in 3/4 cup veggie stock or water, whisking to incorporate.
5. Add 1 cup almond/soy milk next and whisk to stir again. Season with a touch more salt and pepper bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to low to thicken. Cook for 5-7 minutes more, or until thick and bubbly. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed.
6. Remove from heat and add 1/2 cup of the fried onions and all of the cooked green beans. Toss to coat well, and top with remaining fried onions.
Bake for 15 minutes, or until warmed through and bubbly and slightly browned on top. Serve immediately (handle pan carefully).
