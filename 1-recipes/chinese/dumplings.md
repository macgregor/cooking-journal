# Chinese Dumplings

## Ingredients
* 1 cup button mushrooms, medium dice
* 4 clove garlic, minced
* 1/2 cup carrot, finely diced
* 1 cup cabbage, finely diced
* 1 tbsp ginger, grated
* 1 tbsp scallion whites, minced
* 1/2 tsp sugar
* 2 tsp sesame oil
* 2 tsp soy sauce
* 1/2 tsp white pepper powder
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 2 tsp cornstarch
* 24 packaged dumpling skins or wanton wrappers (keep tightly wrapped until ready to use)
* 1 tbsp vegetable oil (for cooking)
* 1 recipe [dumpling sauce](../sauces_and_dressing/dumpling_sauce.md) (optional)

## Instructions
### Preparing Dumplings
1. Put in a colander or sieve over the sink or a large bowl, sprinkle liberally with salt (about ¼tsp), and leave to drain for at least 30 minutes. This will extract some moisture and season the cabbage.
2. While the cabbage sits, sauté 1 cup diced mushroom and 4 cloves minced garlic over medium heat until soft.
3. Squeeze out the cabbage and add to a very large bowl. Add sautéed mushrooms and garlic, 1/2 cup diced carrot, 1 tbsp grated ginger, 1 tbsp minced scallion whites, 1/2 tsp sugar, 2 tsp sesame oil, 2 tsp soy sauce, 1/2 tsp white pepper powder, 1/4 tsp salt, 2 tsp cornstarch. Mix well.
4. Prepare a dumpling wrapping station with a small bowl of water, your skins, your filling with a spoon, and large parchment-lined plate or tray to hold finished dumplings. To begin wrapping the dumpling, place a little less than a tablespoon of the filling in the middle of the wrapper. Dip one finger in the water and wet half of the outer edges of the dumpling. Fold the wrapper in half and pinch the center together. Starting from the center, start pleating each side. Make 2 to 3 pleats on each side of the dumpling, pinching tightly shut. Place on plate. Repeat with remaining dumplings, making sure they don't touch on the plate.

### Cooking Dumplings
1. To pan-fry the dumpling, heat 1 tablespoon of oil on medium high heat in a large non-stick pan with a lid. When the oil is shimmering, add the dumplings, trying to avoid letting them touch each other.
2. Pan-fry, until the bottom of the dumplings are golden, about 2 minutes.
3. Holding the lid of the pan in one hand, pour 1/4 cup of water into the pan. Cover the pan with the lid and steam the dumplings for 2 minutes.
4. After 2 minutes, remove the lid. Most of the water should have evaporated. If there’s a little water remaining in the pan, it’s ok. Continue pan-frying the dumplings, swirling occasionally, until the bottoms are crispy again and any remaining water is gone.

## Storage
Store prepared, but *uncooked*, dumplings in the freezer. After forming dumplings, place the entire tray into freezer for 15 to 20 minutes (or whenever you remember them). Once they are partially frozen you can move to a plastic bag for long term storage. No need to thaw or do anything special when cooking.

## Notes
* Save yourself time and effort by dicing the carrot and cabbage in a food processor.
* Filling can be made a few hours in advance.
* Save the greens from your scallions to add to your [dumpling sauce](../sauces_and_dressing/dumpling_sauce.md).
* You could also add some firm tofu, pressed to extract moisture and diced into 1/4 inch cubes.
* Keep dumpling wrappers (and prepped dumplings) covered with a damp cloth to keep them from drying out.
* Try not to let dumplings touch at pretty much any step (except long term freezing, after they have been partially frozen on the pan) as they tend to stick and the wrapper will tear when you try to get them apart.
