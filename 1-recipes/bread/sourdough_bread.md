# Artisan Sourdough Bread

## Equipment
* cast iron dutch oven

## Ingredients
* 100 g active [sourdough starter](sourdough_starter.md)
* 200 g water
* 300 g King Arthur bread flour
* 6 g of salt

## Instructions
1. Add 200 g of water to a bowl and mix in 100 g of active sourdough starter. Mix until starter and water are incorporated.
2. Add 300 g of King Arthur bread flour to the bowl and mix by hand until there are no lumps of flour. Cover and let rest for 30 minutes, this is called autolyse and lets the flour fully hydrate.
3. Add 6 g of salt and a splash of water. Mix into dough until just incorporated.
4. Remove dough from the bowl and place on a large clear surface for kneading. Use the [slap and fold technique](https://youtu.be/APEavQg8rMw?t=3m20s) to knead the dough for about 10 minutes until the dough firms up and becomes elastic. As you knead it you are developing and organizing the gluten in the dough that will make the bread chewy and develop air pockets in the bread.
4. Place dough back in bowl, cover, leave in a warm place to proof for 4 hours.
5. Dump back onto counter and [shape into a loose ball](https://youtu.be/APEavQg8rMw?t=4m30s): Gently stretch and fold 1 side of the dough, rotate a quarter turn and repeat 3 times. Flip dough over, cover and let bench rest for 30 minutes.
6. Sprinkle with flour and [shape into a round loaf](https://youtu.be/APEavQg8rMw?t=5m3s)
7. Place in a towel lined bowl or proofing basket using flour to prevent sticking. Cover and place in refrigerator overnight to proof. Remove from fridge 2 hours before baking.
8. 30 minutes before baking, place dutch oven in oven and preheat to 480 degrees F
9. Carefully place dough into dutch oven and score the dough. Reduce temperature to 430 degrees F. Bake for 25 minutes with the lid on, remove the lid and bake for another 25 minutes.


## Notes
* if you are keeping your sourdough starter in the fridge you will need to revive it: mix about a tablespoon of your starter with 50 g of water and 50 g bread flour and leave covered in a warm place until doubled in size and passing the water drop test (drop in bowl of water and see if it floats)
