# Buttery Herb Biscuits

## Ingredients
* 300 g all purpose flour, chilled
* 2 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp black pepper
* 2 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped
* 2 tbsp fresh chives, chopped
* 1 1/2 tsp fresh thyme, chopped
* 60 g vegan butter, cubed and chilled
* 113 g (4 oz, 1/2 package) vegan cream cheese, cubed and chilled
* 3/4 cup plain non-dairy milk
* 1 tsp apple cider vinegar

## Mise en place
1. 300 g all purpose flour, 2 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp black pepper, 2 tbsp fresh parsley, 2 tbsp fresh chives, 1 1/2 tsp fresh thyme
2. 60 g vegan butter, 113 g (4 oz, 1/2 package) vegan cream cheese
3. 3/4 cup plain non-dairy milk
4. 1 tsp apple cider vinegar

## Instructions
1. Preheat your oven to 425 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, whisk together the 300 g AP flour, 2 1/2 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp salt, 1/4 tsp pepper, 2 tbsp fresh parsley, 2 tbsp fresh chives, 1 1/2 tsp fresh thyme. Make sure the greenery is well distributed throughout the dry mixture.
3. Use a fork or pastry cutter or two knives to cut the 60 g of vegan butter and 113 g vegan cream cheese into the dry ingredients. Consistency should have pea sized chunks of fat coated in flour, there shouldn't be any dry flour at the bottom.
4. Stir in 3/4 cup non-dairy milk and 1 tsp vinegar, and mix with a wide spatula or by hand just until the thick batter comes together.
5. On a very lightly floured surface, pat out the dough to about 1 – 1 1/2 inches tall. Use a 2-inch round cookie cutter to cut out the biscuits, and space them out equally across your prepared baking sheet. Gather up any scrapes, pat back into shape, and cut again, until the dough is all used up. You should get 6 – 8 tall biscuits out of the mix.
6. (Optional) If desired, brush a small amount of melted margarine across the tops of the biscuits for an extra buttery flavor
7. Bake at 425 degrees for 18 – 22 minutes, until golden brown all over. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before eating.

## Notes
* biscuit dough is similar to pastry dough such as [pie crust](../sweets/pies/pie_crust.md) so the same techniques you have for something like that should work here.
* first attempt my biscuits did not rise, I have a couple theories why and will try to do a little research into both:
  * waiting too long between mixing/stamping to baking - the apple cider vinegar reacts with the baking powder to create carbon dioxide which causes the dough to rise. This reaction starts basically as soon as you mix the wet and dry ingredients. You should try to have them in the oven as quickly as possible after mixing in the wet ingredients.
  * old baking powder - old baking powder might not react as well leading less rise. You can test the freshness by mixing a small spoonful of baking powder with 1/4 cup of hot water. The baking powder should bubble vigorously.
  * don't over work the dough - mixing and kneading develop gluten which will make your biscuits less fluffy
  * don't twist cutter when stamping out biscuits, just press straight down
