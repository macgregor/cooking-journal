# Sourdough Starter


## Equipment
* large glass container (I use a 1 pint wide mouth mason jar)


## Ingredients
### Initial Starter
* 250g warm, filtered tap water
* 125g bread flour
* 125g whole wheat flour

### Feeding
* 125g warm, filtered tap water
* 62g bread flour
* 62g whole wheat flour

## Instructions
1. measure out 250g filtered water, 125g bread flour and 125g whole wheat flour into a relatively large container. mix well by hand (using your hand adds some of the initial yeast to the starter)
2. cover container loosely or with a piece of porous cloth (e.g. cheese cloth), you want some air to get in while keeping dust and bugs out. Leave in warm place (65 - 68 degrees F is optimal) for about 24 hours. Bubbles should appear on the top of the batter indicating that the yeast is active and producing carbon dioxide. Any liquid on top is alcohol ("hooch") and can be mixed back in to your starter or discarded.
3. Feed and strengthen your starter. remove half of batter and discard (see notes below for ideas on what to do with the discarded starter other than throwing it away). add back water and flour equal to how much you removed: 125g filtered water, 62g bread flour and 62g whole wheat flour. Mix well, no need to use your hand at this point.
4. Cover container loosely or with a piece of porous cloth and place in warm spot in kitchen just like before.
5. Check starter every 24 hours or so and repeat the feeding and strengthening process for 3 to 5 days. Try to feed the same time each day.
6. When your starter doubles in volume between feedings it is ready for use. To be sure, use the float test to determine when your starter is ready to use: drop a spoonful of the batter into a bowl of water, if it floats your starter is ready to use, if it sinks, repeat the feeding/strengthening process. Use immediately to bake bread or see storage instructions below.


## Storage
Can be kept alive indefinitely if fed regularly.

### Short Term - feed daily
Leave on counter, loosely covered, feeding once every 12 to 24 hours following steps 3 and 4 above.

### Long Term - refrigerate, feed weekly
Store in loosely covered container in refrigerator, feed once a week following steps 3 and 4 above. Seal container, dont use cloth like the initial feeding phase, but you dont want an air tight seal either or you might end up with a yeast bomb and a messy refrigerator. Allow starter to rest on counter for about 2 hours after feeding before putting back into refrigerator. Before using to bake, feed for a couple days at room temperature following steps 3 and 4 above. Use float test (step 6) to determine when your starter is ready to use.


### Really Long term - months to a year

## Notes
* this recipe uses a 1:1 ratio of water to flour. The ratio of flour to water is much more important than the actual amount. Scale it up or down as you need. You can use any combination of flours you want to achieve different flavor profiles, just make sure they add up to the weight of water you add, e.g. 250g water and 125g bread flour + 125g whole wheat flour. Ratio applies to both initial starter and any feedings.
* different flours are apparently better for yeast formation and flavors. Some sources claim rye is best, some start with pure whole wheat and then switch to a 1:1 whole wheat to white mix for feeding. Will research/experiment with this further at some point in the future.
* the yeast in this recipe comes from the air, the dry flour, the container, water, and especially your hands. basically the natural yeast all around you in your environment. This is why the initial starter is mixed by hand, to add a little extra yeast to help it get started.
* using filtered water is important because tap water usually is chemically treated with chlorine (and probably other things) that will kill the yeast. apparently a britta filter will get that out, but I doubt it gets everything or is even that effective. It probably just gives your starter a little bit of an advantage over regular tap water. Some buy purified water to use for this. Seems like overkill.
* [hooch](https://www.sourdoughhome.com/index.php?content=hooch) is a possible by product of your sourdough starter. It is common and ok when activating your starter but you probably shouldnt see any when you are maintaing it over long periods. Hooch during maintenance is a sign that you arent feeding your starter enough. The 1:1 flour to water ratio in this recipe should prevent hooch during maintenance if you feed it regularly and often enough.

#### Day 1
Had to go buy a larger glass container because my 1 pint mason jars werent big enough. Got what I think is a half gallon mason jar, it wasnt labeled properly in the store. Still cautiously cut the recipe in half: 250g water, 125g AP flour, 125g whole wheat flour. There is still plenty of room after mixing, think for first feeding I will not discard half to bring recipe up to full strength then discard half as normal maintaining a total weight of 1000g. Also forgot to use filtered water, simply adding warm tap water. Whoops. Hopefully this wont impact taste or anything.


#### Day 2
Morning: Mixture very thick, seems thicker than most I see online but that is probably due to water to flour ratios or maybe it will get soupier farther in the process. Some bubbles but still pretty inactive. Mostly just smells like wet whole wheat flower, but there is a little yeasty smell.

Night: Feed at 6pm. 250g (filtered!) water, 125g AP flour, 125g whole wheat flour. No discard, total weight after feeding should be 1000g give or take. Now taking up around half my container. By the time I went to bed it had already grown noticeably by maybe a third. I wonder if it would have grown more noticeably initially if I had used filtered water instead of tap.


#### Day 3
Morning: Woke up and whoa, its grown alot. I hope it doesnt outgrow my container. Stronger sour smell. Not overwhelming or bad, but noticeable. Undertones of yeast but faint. I dont think I need this much starter on hand, I will look up some recipes and probably scale it back.

Night: Feed at 6pm. The starter shrunk back down to normal size, about half the size of the container. Interesting band of liquid in the middle of the liquid, assume this is alcohol. Mixed back together before feeding. Very strong sour smell. Not sure what is normal here, it isnt exactly sickening not rotten but it is strong. The starter is now the more soupy consistency I see online. I am scaling back the amounts significantly and moving to a new, smaller container (a 1 pint wide mouth mason jar). Total weight now is about 400g. I added 200g of the growing starter to a clean jar and then fed with 100g water, 50g whole wheat flour and 50g of AP flour. Going to update recipe to target a 500g starter. After scaling back and feeding the sour smell is much more reasonable. Need to look in to what is normal.


#### Day 4
Morning: Looking good. Didnt bloom up like it did after the first feeding. Im assuming that was due to some giant burst of activity producing lots of gas and its not something that happens every time you feed. There is a pronounced sour smell but it isnt as powerful as yesterday evening before I fed and scaled it back. This could be from simply having less volume of starter now. Film of liquid on top, this is called hooch in sourdough circles. Hooch is common and fine when activating a starter but you shouldnt have any if you properly maintain your starter after activating. I've been mixing it back in before feeding, which is normal. If there is alot I may discard it.

Night: Feed at 6pm. Scaling up slightly to hit my new recipe target weight of 500g total starter, currently it is at approximately 400g. Remove 150g starter, add 125g filtered water, 62g whole wheat flour, 62g AP flour.
