# Sourdough Starter


## Equipment
* large glass container (I use a 1 quart wide mouth mason jar)


## Ingredients
### Initial Starter
* 250 g warm, filtered tap water
* 125 g bread flour
* 125 g whole wheat flour

### Feeding
* 125 g warm, filtered tap water
* 62 g bread flour
* 62 g whole wheat flour

## Instructions
1. measure out 250 g filtered water, 125 g bread flour and 125 g whole wheat flour into a relatively large container. mix well by hand (using your hand adds some of the initial yeast to the starter)
2. cover container loosely or with a piece of porous cloth (e.g. cheese cloth), you want some air to get in while keeping dust and bugs out. Leave in warm place (65 - 68 degrees F is optimal) for about 24 hours. Bubbles should appear on the top of the batter indicating that the yeast is active and producing carbon dioxide. Any liquid on top is alcohol ("hooch") and can be mixed back in to your starter or discarded.
3. Feed and strengthen your starter. remove half of batter and discard (see notes below for ideas on what to do with the discarded starter other than throwing it away). add back water and flour equal to how much you removed: 125 g filtered water, 62 g bread flour and 62 g whole wheat flour. Mix well, no need to use your hand at this point.
4. Cover container loosely or with a piece of porous cloth and place in warm spot in kitchen just like before.
5. Check starter every 24 hours or so and repeat the feeding and strengthening process for 3 to 5 days. Try to feed the same time each day.
6. When your starter doubles in volume between feedings it is ready for use. To be sure, use the float test to determine when your starter is ready to use: drop a spoonful of the batter into a bowl of water, if it floats your starter is ready to use, if it sinks, repeat the feeding/strengthening process. Use immediately to bake bread or see storage instructions below.


## Storage
Can be kept alive indefinitely if fed regularly.

### Short Term - feed daily
Leave on counter, loosely covered, feeding once every 12 to 24 hours following steps 3 and 4 above.

### Long Term - refrigerate, feed weekly
Store in loosely covered container in refrigerator, feed once a week following steps 3 and 4 above. Seal container, don't use cloth like the initial feeding phase, but you don't want an air tight seal either or you might end up with a yeast bomb and a messy refrigerator. Allow starter to rest on counter for about 2 hours after feeding before putting back into refrigerator. Before using to bake, feed for a couple days at room temperature following steps 3 and 4 above. Use float test (step 6) to determine when your starter is ready to use.


### Really Long term - months to a year

## Notes
* this recipe uses a 1:1 ratio of water to flour. The ratio of flour to water is much more important than the actual amount. Scale it up or down as you need. You can use any combination of flours you want to achieve different flavor profiles, just make sure they add up to the weight of water you add, e.g. 250 g water and 125 g bread flour + 125 g whole wheat flour. Ratio applies to both initial starter and any feedings.
* different flours are apparently better for yeast formation and flavors. Some sources claim rye is best, some start with pure whole wheat and then switch to a 1:1 whole wheat to white mix for feeding. Will research/experiment with this further at some point in the future.
* the yeast in this recipe comes from the air, the dry flour, the container, water, and especially your hands. basically the natural yeast all around you in your environment. This is why the initial starter is mixed by hand, to add a little extra yeast to help it get started.
* using filtered water is important because tap water usually is chemically treated with chlorine (and probably other things) that will kill the yeast. apparently a Britta filter will get that out, but I doubt it gets everything or is even that effective. It probably just gives your starter a little bit of an advantage over regular tap water. Some buy purified water to use for this. Seems like overkill.
* [hooch](https://www.sourdoughhome.com/index.php?content=hooch) is a possible by product of your sourdough starter. It is common and ok when activating your starter but you probably shouldn't see any when you are maintaining it over long periods. Hooch during maintenance is a sign that you aren't feeding your starter enough. The 1:1 flour to water ratio in this recipe should prevent hooch during maintenance if you feed it regularly and often enough. You can also simply get separation of water and flour if you use too much water, again weighing the amount of water you add should prevent this.

### Experiments
I kept more detailed notes on some of my experiments with different recipes while tuning this one. You can read there [here](../../3-journal/1-projects/sourdough_starter_experiments.md).

Debra is a microbiologist who goes into some details about what is going on during the process of starting and maintaining your starter. Really good info in here if you read it all. It uses an acidic fruit juice (pineapple) to jump start the starter, then switches to water. Will try this with trial 2.
