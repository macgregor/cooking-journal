# A Very Vegan Thanksgiving
Well, I didn't think I would be doing traditional Thanksgiving with my family this year. We all had plans for the day of, but mine fell through and some people still wanted some family time so now I have a week to plan a meal I will largely be the only cook for and in a town 3 hours away. Ill have to transport a lot of my kitchen staples with me, buy a bunch of extra stuff when I get there and do some prep probably pretty late into the night after work plus driving to Charlotte. Then wake up early to be able to put a bow on things. Sounds like a fund challenge. The best news is my sister is trying a vegan diet so hopefully some of my vegan food goes over well.

I'm think my ~2 years of meal prep experience will give me some valuable insights here, but it will still be work. I'm up for it though.
