# A Very Vegan Thanksgiving
Well, I didn't think I would be doing traditional Thanksgiving with my family this year. We all had plans for the day of, but mine fell through and some people still wanted some family time so now I have a week to plan a meal I will largely be the only cook for and in a town 3 hours away. Ill have to transport a lot of my kitchen staples with me, buy a bunch of extra stuff when I get there and do some prep probably pretty late into the night after work plus driving to Charlotte. Then wake up early to be able to put a bow on things. Sounds like a fund challenge. The best news is my sister is trying a vegan diet so hopefully some of my vegan food goes over well.

I'm think my ~2 years of meal prep experience will give me some valuable insights here, but it will still be work. I'm up for it though.

## Planning

### Supplies

#### Bring
* pie pans
* Pyrex casserole dishes
* brown sugar
* corn syrup
* corn starch
* flour
* baking powder
* baking soda
* maple syrup
* apple cider vinegar
* pumpkin pie spice mix: 1/2 tsp cinnamon, 1/2 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp ground ginger, 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg, 1/4 tsp ground allspice

#### Buy
* 1, 14 oz can pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling)
* 1, 14 oz can full-fat coconut milk
* earth balance (320 g + 7 tbsp)
* fresh parsley
* fresh chives
* fresh thyme
* fresh rosemary
* vegan cream cheese
* soy milk
* 4 pounds russet or Yukon Gold potatoes
* garlic
* 1 pound green beans
* 1 shallot
* 1 cup finely chopped mushrooms (button, baby bella, or cremini)
* crispy fried onions
* silken tofu

### Meal Prep

#### Night Before
* bake pies - blind bake pecan pie crust during first 10 minutes of pumpkin pie bake, reduce heat to 350 degrees and take out pecan pie shell. Fill, bake. Pecan pie might need to come out a little after the pumpkin pie.

#### Morning Of
* make biscuits, cover baking pan with plastic wrap and leave in fridge. will bake at the farm.
* make potatoes, stop before the final baking step. cover baking pan with plastic wrap and leave in fridge. will bake at the farm.
* make green bean casserole, stop before final bake step.

#### At Farm
* roast potatoes at 450 for 20 minutes. flip/turn potatoes, return to oven for 20 minutes. put in biscuits and bake for 12 minutes and check. We are cooking a little hotter than the recipe calls for so they might not need the 18-22 minutes it calls for. Continue flipping potatoes occasionally and until both potatoes and biscuits are ready.
* bake green bean casserole at 400 for 15 minutes

## Retrospective
Overall the food turned out very well. I can nitpick, and I will, but all of it seemed to go over well. We ended up eating about an hour later than anticipated, some things took longer than anticipated, mainly the roasted potatoes. Need to give those more lead time next time. The other disappointment was that the biscuits did not rise, like, at all. They were still very good, but they were flat and I'm not sure why. Ill look in to it and add notes to the recipe. I was also just a little disappointed in the pie crusts, they didn't get as well done as I would like and the pecan pie filling was a bit of an unappealing gray color rather than a nice caramel. I think using molasses or dark corn syrup would help the color. The meal prep was not that much harder than any of my usual Sunday meal preps, though it was a little trickier timing all the recipes to be finished at the same time and transporting them at various stages of readiness. Prepping in my own kitchen would have reduced the complexity significantly.

The Good:
* meal prepping skills are strong.
* potatoes were great, took a long time to brown and I forgot the reserved garlic and rosemary but they were still awesome.
* green bean casserole was flawless, might add directions for homemade fried onion topping but the store bought ones made things simple.

The Bad (aka the nitpicking less than perfect):
* pie crusts - pecan pie needed to blind bake a little longer, the dough recipe still doesn't make enough to get a pretty crust, pumpkin pie crust was a little less flaky/crispy than I like may look in to blind baking it as I do with the pecan pie.
* biscuits - did not rise one bit. I am not sure if I put baking soda instead of baking powder or something like that or if they just didn't like the long wait between mixing and baking (probably about 2 hours apart, no refrigeration).

That said, it was all still very good. Some recipes just need some tweaks to make them a little better.
