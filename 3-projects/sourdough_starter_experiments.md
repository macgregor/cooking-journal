# Creating a Sourdough Starter Recipe


## Trial 1 - "Luna"
My first attempt. I learned a lot. I started out by following a recipe I put together based mostly on [How to make a sourdough starter by Jacob Burton](https://stellaculinary.com/cooking-videos/stella-bread/sb-003-how-make-sourdough-starter) with some techniques thrown in from a few other sources. The amounts originally were enormous and I scaled them up or down a few times. It also got fairly cold around day 4. I think these variations played a part in the slow start.


**Date**: 11/05/2017, 6 pm.
* **Starter**: 250 g (unfiltered, mistake) water, 125 g King Arthur whole wheat, 125 g Gold Medal AP Flour.
* **Feed**: 250 g water, 125 g King Arthur whole wheat, 125 g Gold Medal AP Flour.

**Date**: 11/07/2017, scaled down to fit in smaller container
* **Starter**: 200 g
* **Feed**: 100 g water, 50 g King Arthur whole wheat flour, 50 g Gold Medal AP Flour

**Date**: 11/08/2017, scaled up to match new target recipe above
* **Starter**: 250 g
* **Feed**: 125 g water, 62 g King Arthur whole wheat flour, 62 g Gold Medal AP Flour

### Day 1
Had to go buy a larger glass container because my 1 quart mason jars weren't big enough. Got what I think is a half gallon mason jar, it wasn't labeled properly in the store. Still cautiously cut the recipe in half: 250 g water, 125 g AP flour, 125 g whole wheat flour. There is still plenty of room after mixing, think for first feeding I will not discard half to bring recipe up to full strength then discard half as normal maintaining a total weight of 1000 g. Also forgot to use filtered water, simply adding warm tap water. Whoops. Hopefully this wont impact taste or anything.


### Day 2
**Morning**: Mixture very thick, seems thicker than most I see online but that is probably due to water to flour ratios or maybe it will get soupier farther in the process. Some bubbles but still pretty inactive. Mostly just smells like wet whole wheat flower, but there is a little yeasty smell.

**Night**: Feed at 6 pm. 250 g (filtered!) water, 125 g AP flour, 125 g whole wheat flour. No discard, total weight after feeding should be 1000 g give or take. Now taking up around half my container. By the time I went to bed it had already grown noticeably by maybe a third. I wonder if it would have grown more noticeably initially if I had used filtered water instead of tap.


### Day 3
**Morning**: Woke up and whoa, its grown a lot (note: in retrospect this is almost certainly a "false raise" from Leuconostoc bacteria that is a precursor to the yeast we want). I hope it doesn't outgrow my container. Stronger sour smell. Not overwhelming or bad, but noticeable. Undertones of yeast but faint. I don't think I need this much starter on hand, I will look up some recipes and probably scale it back.

**Night**: Feed at 6 pm. The starter shrunk back down to normal size, about half the size of the container. Interesting band of liquid in the middle of the liquid, assume this is alcohol. Mixed back together before feeding. Very strong sour smell. Not sure what is normal here, it isn't exactly sickening not rotten but it is strong. The starter is now the more soupy consistency I see online. I am scaling back the amounts significantly and moving to a new, smaller container (a 1 quart wide mouth mason jar). Total weight now is about 400 g. I added 200 g of the growing starter to a clean jar and then fed with 100 g water, 50 g whole wheat flour and 50 g of AP flour. Going to update recipe to target a 500 g starter. After scaling back and feeding the sour smell is much more reasonable. Need to look in to what is normal.


### Day 4
**Morning**: Looking good. Didn't bloom up like it did after the first feeding. I'm assuming that was due to some giant burst of activity producing lots of gas and its not something that happens every time you feed. There is a pronounced sour smell but it isn't as powerful as yesterday evening before I fed and scaled it back. This could be from simply having less volume of starter now. Film of liquid on top, this is called hooch in sourdough circles. Hooch is common and fine when activating a starter but you shouldn't have any if you properly maintain your starter after activating. I've been mixing it back in before feeding, which is normal. If there is a lot I may discard it.

**Night**: Feed at 6 pm. Not much change since morning, a little more hooch and a slightly stronger sour smell. It got a little cold while I was at work. About 62 degrees when I got home, probably colder, that might have impeded growth. Scaling up slightly to hit my new recipe target weight of 500 g total starter, currently it is at approximately 400 g. Remove 150 g starter (250 g starter remaining), add 125 g filtered water, 62 g whole wheat flour, 62 g AP flour.


### Day 5
**Morning**: I'm starting to worry Luna is dead, or at least not very active for some reason. Looking the same as yesterday morning, not very bubbly, hooch on top, same size. I've been doing some research and it may not be hooch (alcohol) on top. It could just be water separating from the flour. It seems like this happens more commonly when you add too much water. Since I am weighing my ingredients and not using volume cups, this shouldn't really be the case. Need to taste it when I get home. As for whether or not it is dead, reading [this](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/10359/discouraged-southeast#comment-54426) makes me think it is simply developing slowly due to the temperature of my kitchen:
> When using just flour and water, many will grow a gas-producing bacterium that slows down the process. It can raise the starter to three and a half times its volume in a relatively short period -- something to behold. But not to worry; it is harmless. In fact, this bacterium is used in other food fermentation like cheeses and vegetables, and it is all around us in the environment, including wheat fields and flour. It does not grow at a pH less than 4.8, and the specified fruit juices serve to keep the pH low enough to by-pass it. Things will still progress, but this is the point at which people get frustrated and quit, because when the pH drops below 4.8, and it will, the gassy bacteria stop growing. It will appear that the "yeast" died on you, when in fact, you haven't begun to grow yeast yet. But they will come -- really, they're already there. When the pH drops below 3.5 - 4 or so, the yeast will activate, begin to grow, and the starter will expand again. You just need to keep it fed and cared for until then.

Will continue to feed as normal until the weekend before giving up and starting over.

**Night**: Feed at 6 pm. Remove 250 g starter, feed with 125 g filtered water, 62 g whole wheat flour, 62 g AP flour. Still seems inactive. Same hooch, same smell. After reading some blogs and forums I am going to keep feeding this one a little longer while also starting my second trial.

### Day 6
No change. Smells bad. No bubbles as far as I can tell. I'm calling it, Luna is officially dead.

### Conclusion
I'm not entirely sure why Luna didn't make it. My best guess is poor planning and too many changing variables. I scaled the volume of starter up and down 3 times to adjust to different container sizes. My original recipe created far too much starter. While I think I kept all the ratios the same and it should have been fine, the stress might have caused problems. There was also a temperature drop on day 4 that wouldn't have helped. I believe the rise I saw on day 3 was a false rise caused by some bacteria that activate before the yeast can. This is pretty common and normally the yeast will active a few days later with regular feeding. Something happened after day 3 that prevented yeast from activating. I also didn't do a good job keeping the sides of the container clean after feeding. Not from lack of trying, my containers didn't lend themselves well to the job.

Lessons learned:
* be prepared and be consistent - I suffered from not fully planning what I was doing. Scaling the recipe up and down, changing containers, forgetting about filtered water...I think Luna suffered for it.
* keep some room temperature filtered water on hand - filtered water was always an afterthought right before feeding. Id put warm tap water into my water filter and use what I need. I've heard of people suggesting leaving your water on the counter for a day before feeding. I'm now leaving a 1 quart mason jar full of filtered water on my counter to use with starters.
* control as many variables as possible - keep temperature conditions stable, keep containers clean, use the same water, feed at the same time each day, use the same flour.


## Trial 2 - "Fred" and "George"
Inspired by [Debra Wink](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/10901/pineapple-juice-solution-part-2), I want to try a new experiment with a little more planning and control. Two starters, 1 that uses nothing but filtered water and 1 that uses unsweetened pineapple juice for the initial mix and first 2 feedings before switching the water. The acidity in the pineapple juice should prevent the initial "false rise" and smelly bacteria and make room for the yeast we want easier/faster.

Pineapple juice aside, here are some other general changes I am making based on research and my experience with Luna
Changes:
* Smaller batches - should fit in a 1 pint mason jar. Should end up maintaining about 90g of starter in the end.
* smaller ramp ups before discard + feed rather than discard + feed from the outset - the first 3 days, we will be simply adding small amount of flour + liquid, no discarding, no changing containers. After this, you can begin discarding before feeding and putting in clean containers if you want.
* 100% whole wheat starter before discard + feed stage - whole wheat seems to have more stuff yeast needs to get going so I am going to start with 100% whole wheat for the first 3 days. When we get to discard + feed I will switch to a 50/50 mix of whole wheat and AP flour.
* do a better job at keeping the container clean - I struggled to scrape down the sides of the larger containers when making Luna. With the smaller containers I should be able to keep the sides clean easier which will help prevent mold forming.
* room temperature filtered water - I am keeping a jar full of filtered water at room temperature to use for feeding. Before I was adding warm water to my Britta pitcher and using what I needed. Beside being a pain in the ass, it also meant the temperature was uncontrollable.
* same brand flour - coincidentally I am nearly our of the Gold Medal flour and picked up a bag of King Arthur Bread Flour. So now I'm all King Arthur. I've only briefly read about how flour affects the bread you make, need to do more research, but King Arthur seems widely well regarded.

**Date**: 11/10/2017, 6 pm
* Fred - water
  * Initial Starter: 15 g filtered water, 15 g King Arthur whole wheat flour
  * Feed (for 2 days): 15 g filtered water, 15 g King Arthur whole wheat flour
  * Discard + Feed (until active):  maintain a [2:1:1] ratio of starter to water to flour. 45 g starter, 22 g filtered water, 11 g King Arthur whole wheat flour + 11 g King Arthur bread flour
* George - pineapple juice
  * Initial Starter: 15 g unsweetened pineapple juice, 15 g King Arthur whole wheat flour
  * Feed (for 2 days): 15 g unsweetened pineapple juice, 15 g King Arthur whole wheat flour
  * Switch to water, Discard + Feed (until active):  maintain a [2:1:1] ratio of starter to water to flour. 45 g starter, 22 g filtered water, 11 g King Arthur whole wheat flour + 11 g King Arthur bread flour

### Day 1
**Night**: While still mourning Luna, I made Fred and George. These two are designed to be smaller batch, fitting in 1 pint wide mouth mason jars. Ill try not to mess with the amounts as much as I did with Luna. The two are identical, except that George is made with pineapple juice instead of water during the first few feedings. The idea is that the acid in the pineapple juice will prevent some of the smellier, gassier bacteria from being able to grow in the first couple days. The recipe also starts with small amounts of flour and liquid, forming a sort of paste. We add to this for a couple days then switch to the normal discard and feed method.

True to form, both Fred and George look very pasty. They seem identical except that George has a slightly pineapple aroma.

### Day 2
**Morning**: No change. Pasty, smell like pineapple or wet flour respectively. To be expected. Hoping to see a little activity after tonights feeding.

**Night**: First feeding! 15 g whole wheat flour + 15 g water/ pineapple juice as appropriate. No activity I can see. Fred is starting to get a little smelly but not very much. George still smelling like a little sweetie. I spent a good bit of the day cooking so the kitchen was a bit warm. Shouldn't be a problem, just making note of it.

### Day 3
**Morning**: Fred has woken up and doubled in size. He is starting to get smelly too, not too bad though. Yeast, alcohol and a slight sweetness. George appears inactive and still smells like pineapple with some slightly yeasty undertones. The yeast definitely isn't active yet, so when I say it smells yeasty thats just what it reminds me of, that tang of fermentation. Doing some more cooking today so my kitchen might be a little warmer than usual again.

**Night**: Last feeding of the initial starter mixture. Tomorrow I will switch to water and a 1:1 whole wheat to white flour. Currently about 90g of starter in each jar, which doesn't look like much. I think I will feed without discarding tomorrow. Fred is still smelly and had about double the volume of George. When feeding I could see gas bubbling out when I stirred in the water. Fred is starting to get a little thiner. No real change in George.

### Day 4
**Morning**: I see some sizable gas bubbles in both Fred and George but no growth. Same smell profiles from each.

**Night**: Feeding time. Not discard as I'm trying to up the volume a bit. Currently around 90 g of starter, doubling that by adding 45 g filtered water + 22 g whole wheat flour + 22 g white flour. Both Fred and George get the same food from this point forward. George has risen a little bit, it appears a little taller than Fred. Both starters have visible, small and medium sized bubbles but George has many more than Fred. Fred seems to be getting stinkier while George still mostly just smells like pineapple. Interestingly, I've noticed that George doesn't stick to the spoon and sides of the jar nearly as much as Fred. Much easier to manage.

### Day 5
**Morning**: Still not a lot of change. I can see some gas bubbles in both, Fred is stinky and George is a little less pineapple-y since last nights water feeding. No hooch on either unlike Luna.

**Night**: Discarded half and then fed with my 45 g filtered water + 22 g whole wheat flour + 22 g white flour. Both Fred and George are starting to get a batter like consistency, Fred is a little more runny for some reason. I'm starting to transfer to new jars when I feed to try to prevent any mold build up. Fred is still stinkier than George, but I feel like it's not as repulsive as Luna and I think its less stinky than yesterday. Seems more like just a sour smell. Like a strong sourdough I guess. Not much more to say. Starting to get a little nervous that I'm not seeing any growth between feedings but I'm going to stay patient. I am doing everything right, it should activate given enough time.

### Day 6
**Morning**: Bubbles are smaller, both starters are batter like and will flow if I move the jar around. Searched around briefly to make sure I wasn't missing anything, found this handy [flowchart](http://andrewzajac.ca/files/sd4.png) for making a starter. I might add an aerating step in the mornings in the future but I don't want to add another variable at this point. Leaving them in the warmer oven (with or without the light on) is also an option but I need to check the idle temperature of the oven first, and again I don't want to add another variable.

**Night**: Feeding a little late tonight, after 11 pm. Only 1 notable change is that Fred has picked up a distinct smell of alcohol or nail polish. After stirring it, it smelled closer to a weak beer. Doing some research, the nail polish smell means I am not feeding it enough. Strangely, George doesn't have the same smell, though the pineapple notes are going away and the sour smells are starting to grow. Feed them both the same thing as normal.

### Day 7
**Morning**: Fred still with the nail polish smell. I believe if I start a new batch I will feed in the morning and at night. I also think the have been reading about the impact of temperature on growth rates and think that is primarily what is causing my starters to take so long to activate. Apparently the optimal temperature to make a starter at is around [82 degrees](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/comment/267574#comment-267574) with temperatures below 70 taking significantly longer to develop. Commonly people store their starters in the oven with a light on or on top of the fridge. My oven has no light and the fridge didn't seem that warm. They even make . Might have to come up with a [strategy](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/40570/tips-how-keep-your-sourdough-starter-warm) to keep my babies warmer.

**Night**: well, afternoon. I am going to visit family for Thanksgiving and will be on the road during normal feeding time. Feeding about 3 hours early. Fred smelling of nail polish that goes away mostly after giving him a stir. Both Fred and George smell more like a weak beer after stirring. I am bringing both of them with me, hopefully the change in scenery doesn't hurt them.

### Day 8
**Morning**: neglected, was busy cooking for Thanksgiving lunch.

**Night**: fed around 8 pm, 2 hours later than normal. Same smells from each. Batter like consistency. Can seem a couple small bubbles that form after stirring, prior to feeding. I am a little worried about the water I used, I don't think it was filtered. It is "good water" as described by my father but that doesn't mean is is chlorine free. I am getting a little impatient, I don't understand why my yeast is taking so much longer than others online. My best guess is still temperature. I'm going to keep going though, the smell of alcohol, beer, gas bubbles and the consistency all indicate there is fermentation going on, just not enough to cause any growth. I am going to switch to twice daily feedings starting Monday when I am back in Raleigh.  

### Day 9
**Morning**: I've decided to end part of the experiment by murdering Fred. Its horrible I know, but at this point both Fred and George seem to be developing at the same rate with George seemingly a little healthier than Fred. Fred has the nail polish smell and George seems to be starting to grow in volume a little more than Fred. It seems wasteful at this point to continue to discard and feed Fred when they are essentially the same now.

### Conclusion
So this trial went better than Luna overall. While Fred and George both developed an alcohol aroma, it wasn't the really bad smell or hooch that Luna had started to develop. The quantities are also much more reasonable. I also learned a bit about optimal temperature ranges for yeast and lactobacillus growth as well as well as other troubleshooting signs (e.g. nail polish smell) and got to see how pineapple juice (a more acidic starting solution) impacts growth. I will continue to feed George in a new part of this log below.

Lessons Learned:
* pineapple juice will prevent false blooms and bad aromas in the first few days of growth by reducing the pH of the solution to a point that the gassy bacteria responsible for these signs are unable to develop. This will happen naturally as well, the pineapple juice just give your starter a boost by a couple days. It also made scraping down the sides of the jar easier for some reason.
* a warm dark place is very important for yeast development. My cold kitchen seems to be doubling or tripling how long thing are taking to develop. [82 degrees](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/comment/267574#comment-267574) is optimal with temperatures below 70 taking significantly longer to develop.
* nail polish remover/strong alcohol smell = hungry starter - [usually](http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/31535/sourdough-starter-smelling-acetone). Usually this means your starter is going through its food too fast and producing acetone as a by product of. This could be because you aren't feeding it often enough, it is too warm, you keep too much starter when feeding or you are using too much water. I can eliminate too warm and too much water since I'm weighing it. I'm currently feeding a 1:1:1 (45 g starter, water, flour) so I could increase to maybe a 1:2:2 by only keeping 22 g of starter between feedings. I can also feed morning and night. There is also a chance for a different strain of bacteria which produces acetone to activate and take over your culture which is very hard to recover from and will prevent your yeast from ever starting. Its hard to say where I was with Fred.

## Trial 2.1 - "George"
I have retired Fred to the great drain pipe in the sky leaving me with just George. George is now 9 days old, I will continue numbering at 9 rather than restarting the counter. I am going to maintain the same feeding ratios of 1:1:1 (starter:water:flour) with a flour mixture of 1:1 King Arthur Whole Wheat and King Arthur Bread Flour. I am also switching to feeding every 12 hours to try to encourage the yeast to develop faster. Many resources I find reference 12 hour feeding schedules. Hopefully I will finally get an active starter this week and can move to the refrigerator.

### Day 9
**Morning**: Discarded and fed as normal. This is my first morning feeding. Smells slightly of beer before feeding. There seemed to be a little growth from the previous nights feeding.

### Day 10 - 14
I've been a little preoccupied and there hasn't been a whole lot of change. I've been feeding mostly twice a day. While I'm not seeing anywhere close to doubling in size, I am seeing more signs of gas bubbles with parts of the dough being looking sort of like a web or like the crumb of a loaf of bread. Smells like a weak beer after stirring, sour notes.

### Day 15 - 16
Starting to get a little more activity. More small bubbles indicating carbon dioxide production and more rise. Doing better with consistent 12 hour feedings. I'm now convinced you need to feed your starter every 12 hours to get it going. I'm also being more deliberate with stirring it well to get more oxygen in the mix.

### Day 17 - 18
I am becoming frustrated with these sourdough starters. I see people basically just throwing flour and water together and getting a starter a couple days later, but I cannot seem to get active yeast with deliberate effort. Perhaps I am being too hands on but I am not doing that much to it. I have seen very little growth and starting to get the strong alcohol smell Fred had. I am ending George and making a fresh starter.

### Conclusion
I'm a little unsure of why I never got an active starter. My best guess is that at some point during the process some bacteria took over the starter that wouldn't allow the yeast to grow. I'm afraid I might not gleam much from this failure. Some people online have starters that take up to 3 weeks to activate, so perhaps I just needed to give it longer but I've lost hope in George.

## Trial 3 - "Neville"
This starter is going to be very similar to "Fred" from the last experiment. I don't think the the technique is flawed but that something simply went wrong.

**Date**: 11/30/2017, 7 am
* Initial Starter: 15 g filtered water, 15 g King Arthur whole wheat flour
* Feed (for 2 days): 15 g filtered water, 15 g King Arthur whole wheat flour
* Discard + Feed twice a day (until active):  maintain a [2:1:1] ratio of starter to water to flour. 45 g starter, 22 g filtered water, 11 g King Arthur whole wheat flour + 11 g King Arthur bread flour

## Day 1 - 3
Feeding 100% whole wheat flour, no discarding until reaching about 90 g of starter. On the third day I got noticeable volume increase, more than double in size. This is in line with my results last time. This is not yeast, but other gassy bacteria that activate as the pH drops. The acidity needs to continue to lower before the yeast can activate. These gassy guys will be dead tomorrow. The smell during this time goes from wet yeast to a not pleasant but not terrible sour smell.

## Day 4 - 8
Quiet period. Discard and feed each morning. The starter to food ratio is 2:1, that is I am keeping 45 g of starter and feeding it with 45 g of water and 45 g of flour. This should give our bacteria and yeast plenty of food for the next 24 hours. The mixture at feeding is is a thick batter. When mixing vigorously you can see strands and sheets of thin stretchy batter. Unless I am wrong, this is gluten forming and giving the starter elasticity. As the food is consumed the starter will thin and take on a pourable consistency. I am also stirring it vigorously each night when I check on it to give the starter much needed oxygen. The unpleasant smell grows a bit before becoming more and more sour. Near the end of this period I am starting to see some small bubbles on the bottom and sides. These could be leftover air pockets from stirring but I think they are the beginnings of our yeast. I am also starting to see small volume increases when I check at night (approximately 12 hours after feeding). Maybe a half inch of growth at first and growing a little bit more each day. This is a good sign.

## Day 9
Huge growth! Its about doubled in size while I was at work, in maybe 8 hours after feeding. The starter is very light and fluffy with lots of small air pockets. I almost looks like the crumb on a loaf of bread, because it basically is. When stirring it will go back down to its regular size and have a thin, pourable, batter like consistency.  I tried making a savory pancake with the starter discard but I had the heat too high and it did not get properly cooked. Will try again tomorrow.
