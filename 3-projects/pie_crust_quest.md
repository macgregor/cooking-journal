# Quest for the Perfect Pie Crust
I have always struggled with pastry dough recipes, but I've never tried very hard. My only real experience has been with making dough to go on top of pot pies or maybe some cobbler topping. All recipes from cookbooks that don't specialize in baking. Combine that with vegan ingredients and you end up with some not very fun to make or eat dough. So, time to remedy that.

I have been researching different recipes for pie crust and it seems everyone has a slightly different ingredients and techniques. Some use only butter, some use butter and shortening. Some claim vodka helps the crust stay flaky. Some add all kinds of things into the dough. Some recommend a food processor while others claim it will ruin your dough. They all have a few things in common though: flour, water, butter and keeping things cold.

The secret to pie dough seems to be cold ingredients, time and patience. Chill your flour and butter. Chill your dough as you work with it if it gets too warm. Let it rest in the fridge after you shape it in your pie pan before you bake it.

Once you have your ingredients sorted out, then there are the techniques. Most of these seem designed to trouble shoot your pie if you run into problems. For example if your crust gets air pockets in it when you bake it, you can dock the crust. If the edges of your pie get over done but the rest of the pie is good, you can make a pie shield. Many of these techniques have their own variations depending on where you get them. I'll try out different techniques as I go and note what I find.


## Trial 1
[Recipe](../1-recipes/sweets/pie_crust.md) - recipe since modified, [github revision](https://github.com/macgregor/cooking-journal/blob/9827755a98549d7497d7cd2862044b1432bd0cac/1-recipes/sweets/pie_crust.md).

Made full recipe for 2 crusts. My "food processor" (a ninja blender with a food processor bowl/blade) was a little small so I had to add butter and flour in pieces. I might have over processed the dough a little bit, it looked smoother and less clumpy than most pictures or videos I see. I ended up letting the dough rest for a couple hours after mixing in the butter but before adding water. I was cooking lunch and dinner at the same time and overwhelmed myself a bit. It should be fine though. Added about 4 tbsp of cold water, shaped it into discs and let rest in fridge for 3 to 4 hours. The dough weren't quite even and neither was enough to fill my pie pans. Need to add more flour next time. Also when rolling, the edges cracked quite a bit and fell apart easily when moving to pie pan. I'm looking up reasons why and it seems that it can be almost anything, no enough mixing, too much mixing, too little water, not letting it come up in temperature before rolling. Too many things to narrow it down without more tests. I'm docking the nicer looking crust and not docking the other to experiment with what happens if you don't dock.

Whoops. Baked them for way too long. Should have paid more attention but the aluminum foil and sugar made it difficult to see how well the crust was baking. Flavor and texture wise, its not bad even half burnt. I'm snacking on the least burnt bits of the bad pie. The really overcooked pie crust cracked and crumbled pretty easily, but the less over done crust held up better. I was able to gingerly pick it up whole out of the pie pan without it breaking. It also had pretty nice layering when I broke it. So I think the biggest problem came from simply overcooking it. Trying a new batch tomorrow where I change some of the ingredient amounts to make sure I make enough dough and bake for about half the time.


**Problems**:
* not enough dough to fill pie pan - scale up ingredients.
* edges cracking when rolling - many possible root causes. I am going to look be a little more diligent about how much water I add next time and letting the dough rest at room temperature for longer before rolling.
* baked crust for way too long. Also discovered hot spots in my oven. The left side got burned while the one on the right got dark golden, close to burning, but didn't get ruined. Cut bake time in half from 60 minutes to 30 minutes.

**Lessons Learned**:
* There doesn't seem to be a need to dock the crust before blind baking. Both the docked and undocked crust behaved the same way.
* Keep your ingredients cool, but you don't want the dough too cold when you are trying to shape it.
* Don't be overly paranoid about adding water to the dough, under watering can lead to fragile dough

## Trial 2
[Recipe](../1-recipes/sweets/pie_crust.md) - recipe since modified, [github revision](https://github.com/macgregor/cooking-journal/blob/c1b925f15c606916dd1bfb84b4d33f5b4c005aac/1-recipes/sweets/pie_crust.md).

So, Ive reworked the recipe to target a single crust pie that should have plenty of extra dough when rolled out. Amount of flour and butter fit much better in my food processor. I spent less time processing the butter and flour this time and the end result looked much more like what I expect. Small, various sized lumps of butter with very little dry flour hanging about. Added the full 1/4 cup of water at once, no extra tablespoons added. Also mixing with a fork rather than by hand or with a spoon/spatula. Dough formed the shaggy mass like I've seen. Kneaded once to form the dough puck and put in fridge for about an hour. Everything going great so far. Also I'm snacking on the failed pie crust from yesterday, yum.

Dough rolled out well, I could use a little bit more though. There isn't enough overhang to trim it or do anything fancy with the edge. Will add a bit more flour and butter to the recipe. The edges didn't crack nearly as badly this time, I don't think one thing in particular did the trick but that I just did everything a little better. I'm moving any blind baking steps out of the basic pie crust recipe and into the particular pie recipe since it seems different pies need different amounts of baking. The [King Arthur Pecan Pie](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/pecan-pie-recipe) recipe calls for blind baking for 10 minutes at 400 degrees. I had to bake for closer to 15 minutes before the edges started to get golden brown. The edges are getting a little puffy. I thought docking was just for the bottom of the pie, which did not puff up, but apparently you can dock the sides to prevent air bubbles too. I worry with a pie like pecan pie, the liquid would seep into the docking holes. Might just have to deal with it on a per pie basis. Bottom still looks pretty uncooked, which is fine for this recipe. I also tried blind baking with parchment paper and beans this time instead of aluminum and sugar. Seems about as effective as foil + sugar.

My [pecan pie](../1-recipes/sweets/pecan_pie.md) turned out really great. No signs of the bubbles on the side of the pie, though I might not have gotten to them yet. The top edge of the pie got a little over done, apparently there is a thing called a [pie shield](http://thepieacademy.com/how-to-keep-the-edge-of-your-pie-crust-from-burning/) you can make out of aluminum foil. Ill try that next time. That said, it didn't really detract from the pie much. Gave the edge a nice crunch. The bottom of the pie turned out a nice golden color. There are layers you can see in the crust, most noticeably on the sides of the pie. The bottom didn't get soggy, but enough of the pie filling soaked in that its hard to really get the layering effect. Ive reserved a few pieces of the pie to test how well it keeps in various conditions. Will make notes of that in the aforementioned pecan pie recipe.

Second trial was a great success.

**Problems**:
* still not quite enough dough to get a nice edge in the pie pan - scale up ingredients.
* edges a little overdone after making the pie - not after the blind bake, I don't think I overcooked them then. Try out making an aluminum pie shield next time.
* side wall of pie crust had some medium sized air pockets - try docking the sides but might not be possible depending on the kind of pie.

**Lessons Learned**:
* Just add the 1/4 cup of water with confidence, you wont kill your crust especially if you weight the flour out.
* Don't go crazy with the food processor, just pulse a few times at each step, checking the consistency as you go.
